#### stock-price-prediction

The **objective** iss to create a trading instrument suitable for **low-risk** appetite users that can beat benchmark interest rates to improve wealth accumulation for the masses.

Our **approach** is to derive and engineer a machine learning-based model to predict the up/down movement of stock prices to inform buy/sell decisions. We eventually adopted a Random Forest (RF) model that requires only six input features to make a good prediction, generating modest returns. A simple-to-employ method can lower the barrier to mass adoption. While the privileged would inevitably have more resources to develop even more advanced tools to generate greater returns, mass adoption of investment would help to prevent wealth inequality from widening further. Nevertheless, this approach is all but one in a multi-prong process to solve wealth inequality. Other strategies include, but are not limited to: addressing income inequality and taxation policies.

**Outcomes** Our model-guided approach for balancing a 10-stock portfolio resulted in a modest return (4.8% in Oct-2022), beating both risk-free interest rates and the straits times index. The tool is suitable for further development before mass adoption.
